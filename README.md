# AI-ML-Feature-generation

Generates features n features as provided by the user from (1, 2, ..., n). Searches for the best combination of features using forward, backward, and my own algorithm(Each feature given a random non-negative value). My algorithm uses epsilon to mix forward Greedy and Breadth First search.
