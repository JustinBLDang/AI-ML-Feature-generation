# AI-ML-Feature-generation

Feature Generation for 100 instances of data with 10 Features each. Using my own algorithm which takes a percentage(epsilon) and checks features that have an accuracy within epsilon of the best feature set we have searched thus far. Epsilon 0 is a Greedy Forward Search Epsilon 100 is a breadth first search.
